# Object Recognition
<em>Project is in progress...</em>

Mask R-CNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and state-of-the-art in terms of image segmentation and object recognition. This variant of a Deep Neural Network detects objects in an image and generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. Finally, all instances in the image are classified.
